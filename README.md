# My-mini-Projects
My mini Projects is a collection of small and fun projects that I have created using various programming languages and technologies. These projects showcase my skills, creativity, and passion for coding and learning new things. Some of the projects include:

- A Rock-Paper-Scissor game written in C++ that can be played on the terminal
-
-
- (others coming up)

These projects are open source and licensed under the GNU GPLv3 License, which means anyone can use, modify, and distribute them freely. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions from other developers who are interested in these projects. You can find the source code, documentation, and instructions on how to run these projects on my GitHub repository.
I hope you enjoy exploring my mini projects and find them useful or inspiring. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me through my email or social media accounts. Thank you for visiting my repository! ðŸ˜Š
